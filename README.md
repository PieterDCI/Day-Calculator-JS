# This app was a little challenge proposed by a teacher

## The challenge is the following:

- Create a JS function that will accept startingDate and endDate as parameters in dd/mm/yyy format
- Without using the Date class and its methods this function should return the total number of days between these two dates
- NEEDS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT LEAP YEARS
- function daysCalculator(startingDate, endDate)
- function must return the total number of days between them
- Print those days on terminal using the console.log

WHEN TESTING THE APP, PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THE CORRECT DATE FORMAT

## To start app:

node dayCalculator.js
